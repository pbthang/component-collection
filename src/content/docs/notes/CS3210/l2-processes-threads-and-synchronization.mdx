## Processes & Threads

### Process

import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import processMemory from "./l2-processes-threads-and-synchronization/untitled.png";

  <figcaption class="text-center text-sm !mt-0">Memory of a process</figcaption>
</figure>

A program in execution, identified by PID

- Comprises: executable program (PC), global data (OS resources: open files, network connections), stack or heap, and current values of the registers (GPRs and Special)
- Own address space: exclusive access to its data
- Two or more processes exchange data â†’ need explicit communication

**Multi-programming (Multitasking):**

import processStateGraph from "./l2-processes-threads-and-synchronization/untitled-1.png";

  <figcaption class="text-center text-sm !mt-0">Process State Graph</figcaption>
</figure>

- Several processes at different stages of execution
  - Need context switch
  - States of the suspended process must be saved â†’ overhead
- 2 types of execution:
  - **Time slicing** execution â†’ pseudo-parallelism
  - **Parallel execution** of processes on different resources

IPC: Cooperating processes have to share information

- Shared memory â†’ Need to protect access when reading/writing with locks
- Message passing: Blocking & non-blocking, Synchronous & asynchronous
- Unix specific: Pipes & Signal

**Exceptions:**

- Executing a machine level instruction can cause exception
- E.g: Overflow, Underflow, Division by Zero, Illegal memory address, Misaligned memory access
- **Synchronous**: Occur due to program execution
- Have to execute an **exception handler**

**Interrupts:**

- External events can interrupt the execution of a program
- Usually hardware related: Timer, Mouse Movement, Keyboard Pressed, etc
- **Asynchronous**: Occur independently of program execution
- Have to execute an **interrupt handler**

Disadvantages:

- Creating a new process is costly
  - Overhead of system calls
  - All data structures must be allocated, initialized and copied
- Communicating between processes costly â†’ Go through the OS

### Thread

- Extension of process model:
  - A process may consist of multiple independent control flows called threads
  - The thread defines a sequential execution stream within a process(PC, SP, registers)
- Threads share the address space of the process:
  - All threads belonging to the same process see the same value
  - shared-memory architecture
- Thread generation is faster than process generation: No copy of the address space is necessary
- Different threads of a process can be assigned run on different cores of a multicore processor
- 2 types: User-level threads, Kernel threads

**User-level threads:**

- Managed by a thread library â€“ OS unaware of user-level threads so no OS support
- **Advantages**: switching thread context is fast
- **Disadvantages**
  - OS cannot map different threads of the same process to different execution resources â†’ no parallelism
  - OS cannot switch to another thread if one thread executes a blocking I/O operation

**Kernel threads:**

- OS is aware of the existence of threads and can react correspondingly
- Avoid disadvantages of user-level threads
- Efficient use of the cores in a multicore system

:::note
ðŸ’¡ **Global variables** of a program and all **dynamically allocated data objects** are **shared** among threads.
Each thread has a **private runtime stack** for function stack frames.
Runtime stack of a thread exists iff the thread is active.

## Synchronization

### Synchronization mechanisms

Lock:

- `acquire()` and `release()`
- Locks can spin (a **spinlock**) or block (a **mutex**)

Semaphores

- `Semaphore::Wait()`: decrement (also `P()`)
- `Semaphore::Signal()`: increment, (also `V()`)
- Semaphore value is always greater than or equal to 0
- **Mutex** **semaphore** (or binary semaphore): count = 1
- **Counting** **semaphore** (or general semaphore): count = N

Barrier:

### Synchronization problems

Deadlock: exist if and only if the following four conditions hold simultaneously:

1. **Mutual exclusion** â€“ At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode
2. **Hold and wait** â€“ There must be one process holding one resource and waiting for another resource
3. **No pre-emption** â€“ Resources cannot be pre-empted (critical sections cannot be aborted externally)
4. **Circular wait** â€“ There must exist a set of processes \[P1, P2, P3,...,Pn] such that P1 is waiting for P2, P2 for P3, etc

Starvation: side effect of the scheduling algorithm

- A high priority process always prevents a low priority process from running on the CPU
- One thread always beats another when acquiring a lock

### **Classic Synchronization Problems**

Producer-consumer:

- `mutex = Semaphore(1)`; `items = Semaphore(0)`

```python title="Producer"
event = waitForEvent()
mutex.wait()

buffer.add(event)

items.signal()
mutex.signal()
```

```python title="Consumer"
items.wait()
mutex.wait()

event = buffer.get()

mutex.signal()
event.process()
```

Producer-consumer with Finite Buffer:

```python title="Producer"
event = waitForEvent()
spaces.wait()
mutex.wait()

buffer.add ( event )

mutex.signal ()
items.signal ()
```

```python title="Consumer"
items.wait()
mutex.wait()

event = buffer.get()

mutex.signal()
spaces.signal()
event.process()
```

Readers-writers Problem:

- Any number of readers can be in the critical section simultaneously
- Writers must have exclusive access to the critical section
- `int readers = 0`, `mutex = Semaphore (1)`, `roomEmpty = Semaphore (1)`

```python title="Writer"
roomEmpty.wait()
# critical section for writers
roomEmpty.signal()
```

```python title="Readers"
mutex.wait ()
readers += 1
if readers == 1:
  roomEmpty.wait () # first in locks

mutex.signal ()
# critical section for readers
mutex.wait ()

readers -= 1
if readers == 0:
  roomEmpty.signal () # last out unlocks
mutex.signal ()
```
